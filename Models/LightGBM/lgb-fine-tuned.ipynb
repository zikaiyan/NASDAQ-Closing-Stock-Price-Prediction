It uses the `dropna` method with the `subset` parameter set to \"target\" to specify that it should check for missing values in the \"target\" column and remove rows that have missing values. The updated DataFrame is assigned back to the variable `df`.\n","\n","3. `df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)`\n","   - This line resets the index of the DataFrame `df`. When data is removed from a DataFrame, the index labels may have gaps or may not be sequential. This line resets the index to be sequential, starting from 0, and the old index is dropped. The `drop=True` parameter indicates that the old index should be dropped, and `inplace=True` means that this operation modifies the DataFrame in place.\n","\n","4. `df_shape = df.shape`\n","   - This line calculates the shape of the DataFrame `df`, which means it returns a tuple containing the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.
