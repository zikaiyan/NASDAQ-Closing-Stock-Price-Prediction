The adjusted predictions are then clipped to be within a specified range (`y_min` to `y_max`).\n","   - **Submission:** Updates the target in the sample prediction and submits the prediction to the environment.\n","   - **Performance Monitoring:** Tracks the time taken for each iteration (`qps`), and prints the average queries per second every 10 iterations.\n","   - **Time Estimation:** Estimates the total time the code will take to complete all iterations.\n"],"id":"e86c318f"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cc45ac95","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1701623794087,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Zhan Wei Goh","userId":"06506265241458279276"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# 📉 Define a function to adjust prices based on volumes\n","def zero_sum(prices, volumes):\n","    std_error = np.sqrt(volumes)  # 🧮 Calculate standard error based on volumes\n","    step = np.sum(prices) / np.sum(std_error)  # 🧮 Calculate the step size based on prices and standard error\n","    out = prices - std_error * step  # 💰 Adjust prices by subtracting the standardized step size\n","    return out\n","\n","# ℹ️ If in inference mode, use the Optiver 2023 environment\n","if is_infer:\n","    import optiver2023\n","    env = optiver2023.make_env()\n","    iter_test = env.iter_test()\n","    counter = 0\n","    y_min, y_max = -64, 64\n","    qps, predictions = [], []\n","    cache = pd.DataFrame()\n","\n","    # 🚂 Define weights for each fold model\n","    model_weights = [1/len(models)] * len(models)\n","\n","    # 🔄 Loop through each test scenario\n","    for (test, revealed_targets, sample_prediction) in iter_test:\n","        now_time = time.time()\n","        cache = pd.concat([cache, test], ignore_index=True, axis=0)\n","\n","        # 🔄 If not the first iteration, limit the cache to the last 21 rows for each stock\n","        if counter > 0:\n","            cache = cache.groupby(['stock_id']).tail(21).sort_values(by=['date_id', 'seconds_in_bucket', 'stock_id']).reset_index(drop=True)\n","\n","        # 📊 Generate features based on the updated cache\n","        feat = generate_all_features(cache)[-len(test):]\n","\n","        # 📊 Generate predictions for each model and calculate the weighted average\n","        lgb_predictions = np.zeros(len(test))\n","        for model, weight in zip(models, model_weights):\n","            lgb_predictions += weight * model.predict(feat)\n","\n","        # 🧮 Adjust predictions using the zero_sum function\n","        lgb_predictions = zero_sum(lgb_predictions, test['bid_size'] + test['ask_size'])\n","        clipped_predictions = np.clip(lgb_predictions, y_min, y_max)  # 📏 Clip predictions within a specified range\n","        sample_prediction['target'] = clipped_predictions\n","        env.predict(sample_prediction)  # 📈 Submit predictions to the environment\n","        counter += 1\n","        qps.append(time.time() - now_time)\n","\n","        # 🔄 Print the average queries per second every 10 iterations\n","        if counter % 10 == 0:\n","            print(counter, 'qps:', np.mean(qps))\n","\n","    time_cost = 1.146 * np.mean(qps)\n","    print(f\"The code will take approximately {np.round(time_cost, 4)} hours to reason about\")\n"],"id":"cc45ac95"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"500fea6c"},"source":["## Keep Exploring! 👀\n","\n","If you enjoyed exploring this notebook and found it insightful, I encourage you to delve further into my portfolio.\n","\n","👉 [Explore My Portfolio](https://www.kaggle.com/zulqarnainali) 👈\n","\n","## Share Your Feedback and Gratitude 🙏\n","\n","Your feedback is invaluable to us!
