    "## 🚀 Optiver Trading Challenge: XGBoost vs LightGBM Overview 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unveiling the Competitors: XGBoost & LightGBM 🥊\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of machine learning, the algorithms we choose are pivotal in navigating the labyrinth of data towards robust predictions. Two titans stand out in this arena – XGBoost and LightGBM. Both have their unique strengths and are celebrated for their performance, but let's dissect their differences to understand when to use each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌿 LightGBM: The Speedster for Massive Datasets\n",
    "LightGBM, standing tall with its efficiency, is designed to sprint through massive datasets. It boasts a leaf-wise tree growth and histogram-based computing, excelling in classification, regression, and ranking tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages:\n",
    "- **Swift and Scalable**: Thanks to its histogram-based feature binning and leaf-wise growth, LightGBM is a speed demon, especially on large datasets. It converges faster and demands less memory, making it ideal for large-scale applications.\n",
    "- **Precision in Large Data**: Its distributed computing capability makes it a behemoth for handling vast amounts of high-dimensional data, ensuring accurate models even on the grandest of data stages.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: While efficient, its leaf-wise approach may use more memory compared to other gradient boosting algorithms, potentially making it a hungry beast when working with limited memory resources.\n",
    "- **Categorical Features**: LightGBM has a nifty trick up its sleeve – it can effectively handle categorical features by numerical transformation, sidestepping the need for one-hot encoding and keeping the memory usage lean.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Thirsty for Memory**: LightGBM might demand more memory due to its leaf-wise expansion, potentially making it less ideal for memory-constrained situations.\n",
    "- **Noise Sensitive**: Its keen focus on larger gradient samples can lead to overfitting noisy data, necessitating a careful approach to data preparation and feature engineering.\n",
    "- **Categorical Feature Caveat**: Despite its prowess with numerical conversion of categorical features, LightGBM doesn't support native categorical features, often requiring additional preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌲 XGBoost: The Balanced Powerhouse\n",
    "XGBoost shines with its excellent performance and scalability. Renowned for its stellar prediction accuracy and suitability across a range of objectives and metrics, XGBoost is a force to be reckoned with in the machine learning competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages:\n",
    "- **Regularization Champ**: With its L1 and L2 regularization, XGBoost keeps overfitting in check, ensuring that models don't just memorize but generalize well.\n",
    "- **Missing Values Magician**: XGBoost can intuitively handle missing data, saving precious preprocessing time and maintaining the integrity of real-world data handling.\n",
    "- **Categorical Nuance**: Through one-hot encoding, XGBoost gives due diligence to categorical features, preserving their intricate relationships with the target variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Patience Required**: Training on large datasets might test your patience as XGBoost's level-wise growth can be time and resource-intensive.\n",
    "- **Memory Considerations**: Stability comes at a cost – the level-wise method can be heavy on memory, making it a bit cumbersome for constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏁 The Verdict\n",
    "Both LightGBM and XGBoost are stellar performers with their own sets of pros and cons. Your choice might hinge on the scale of the dataset, computational resources, and the importance of model interpretability. In the end, both are capable of delivering the gold in constructing reliable and precise models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Introduction to the Notebook 🚀\n",
    "Armed with the knowledge of these two algorithms, we proceed to use XGBoost in our notebook, leveraging its strengths for our prediction tasks. Follow along as we unravel the story the data tells through XGBoost's robust and precise modeling.\n",

The CSV file is expected to be located at the specified file path, \"/kaggle/input/optiver-trading-at-the-close/train.csv\". This line is loading a dataset from a file.\n",

    "This code defines a function `reduce_mem_usage` that is used to reduce the memory usage of a Pandas DataFrame by optimizing the data types of its columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `def reduce_mem_usage(df, verbose=0):`\n",
    "   - This line defines a function called `reduce_mem_usage` that takes two parameters: `df`, which is the input Pandas DataFrame that needs memory optimization, and `verbose` (defaulting to 0), which is a flag to control whether or not to provide memory optimization information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `start_mem = df.memory_usage().sum() / 1024**2`\n",
    "   - This line calculates the initial memory usage of the input DataFrame `df` and stores it in the `start_mem` variable. It does this by using the `memory_usage()` method, which returns the memory usage of each column, and then sums these values. The result is divided by 1024^2 to convert it to megabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code then enters a loop that iterates through each column of the DataFrame using the `for col in df.columns:` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inside the loop, it checks the data type of the column using `col_type = df[col].dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If the column's data type is not 'object' (i.e., it's numeric), it proceeds with the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For integer columns:\n",
    "   - It checks the minimum and maximum values in the column (c_min and c_max).\n",
    "   - Depending on the range of values, it converts the column to the smallest integer data type that can accommodate the data while reducing memory usage. It checks for `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64` data types based on the data range.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For float columns:\n",
    "   - Similar to integer columns, it checks the minimum and maximum values.\n",
    "   - It converts the column to a `float32` data type if the range is within the limits of `np.finfo(np.float32)`. The `np.finfo()` function is used to get the floating-point type's limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If the column's data type is neither integer nor float and falls outside the specified ranges, it defaults to `float32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If `verbose` is set to a truthy value (e.g., 1), it provides information about memory optimization, including the initial and final memory usage, and the percentage reduction in memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Finally, the function returns the DataFrame with optimized memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is useful for reducing the memory footprint of a DataFrame, especially when working with large datasets, by converting columns to the most memory-efficient data types based on the data they contain. It can help improve performance and reduce memory-related issues."

    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the enhancement of financial time series analysis by leveraging the power of Numba's njit Just-In-Time compilation to calculate rolling averages and their pairwise Euclidean distances, thus creating insightful rolling features. Let's explore the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `from numba import njit, prange`\n",
    "   - This line imports `njit` for JIT compilation, enhancing execution speed, and `prange` for parallel loop processing, enabling concurrent computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `@njit(parallel=True)`\n",
    "   - Applied to our function, this decorator instructs Numba to optimize for performance, allowing for fast, parallel computations of rolling features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `def compute_rolling_features(df_values, window_sizes):`\n",
    "   - Here, we define a function to compute rolling features using Numba, which accepts:\n",
    "     - `df_values`: A NumPy array of the DataFrame values, representing financial time series data.\n",
    "     - `window_sizes`: A list of window sizes for which rolling averages are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `num_rows, num_features = df_values.shape`\n",
    "   - We determine the shape of our input array to understand the scope of our calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `rolling_features = np.empty((num_rows, len(window_sizes) * num_features))`\n",
    "   - An empty array is initialized to hold the computed rolling averages for the different window sizes across all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We iterate over the range of window sizes to compute rolling averages for each size.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `for i in prange(len(window_sizes)):` \n",
    "   - This loop uses `prange` to parallelize the computation of rolling averages for different window sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Within the loop, we use a sliding window approach to calculate the averages across each window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. We then calculate pairwise Euclidean distances between the rolling average features using `np.linalg.norm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. These distances provide a dynamic measure of how different rolling windows of averages compare with each other, capturing trends and volatilities in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The computed distances are structured and returned as a new array, enriching the feature set for the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The resulting rolling features and their distances serve as an input to an XGBoost model, offering the model a nuanced view of temporal patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. `calculate_rolling_features_numba` is an additional function that orchestrates the process, preparing the input data and invoking `compute_rolling_features` to generate and return a DataFrame populated with these new rolling features."

    "### Training and Evaluation with XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The code block outlined below is tasked with training an XGBoost model, provided the `is_train` flag is set to `True`, indicating a training scenario. Should the offline mode be active, the block will also handle model inference and performance assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Condition (`if is_train:`):**\n",
    "   - This conditional statement confirms whether the code execution is meant for model training by checking the `is_train` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Preparation:**\n",
    "   - The list of feature names used for the model is retrieved from the training feature set (`df_train_feats`), under the training condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **XGBoost Parameters:**\n",
    "   - Parameters for the XGBoost model are defined, outlining crucial hyperparameters which dictate the model's performance, such as the objective function, booster type, number of estimators, max depth, subsampling, learning rate, and tree method for GPU acceleration, among others.\n",
    "   - The count of features being used is logged, ensuring transparency in the model's input dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Offline Data Split:**\n",
    "   - An offline data split is created using a mask (`offline_split`) to segregate the dataset based on a predefined date (`split_day - 45`). This split aids in constructing offline training and validation datasets.\n",
    "   - Separate DataFrames for training and validation sets, both features and targets, are instantiated for offline training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Train XGBoost Model:**\n",
    "   - An XGBoost Regressor model (`xgb_model`) is initialized with the set parameters and trained using the offline training feature set and its corresponding target.\n",
    "   - Early stopping and evaluation metrics are set to monitor and halt the training when no improvement is observed in validation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Memory Management:**\n",
    "   - Post-training, memory cleanup is initiated to free resources by removing variables related to training data and invoking garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Inference Setup:**\n",
    "   - The full training dataset's target variable (`df_train_target`) is delineated, and the script proceeds to fine-tune the model for inference purposes.\n",
    "   - An inference model (`infer_model`) is cloned from the primary model with adjustments made to the number of estimators as per the early stopping round's outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Offline Evaluation (when `is_offline` is `True`):**\n",
    "   - In offline mode, the inference model's performance is benchmarked on the validation data (`df_valid_feats`). Predictions are evaluated against actual values using mean absolute error (`mean_absolute_error`).\n",
    "   - The evaluation score is presented, offering insight into the model's accuracy in an offline setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework ensures a robust model training and evaluation process, emphasizing early stopping and estimator adjustment for optimal performance, complemented by effective resource management practices.\n"

    "### Inference and Submission with XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block is specifically tailored for generating predictions in the inference mode and subsequently submitting these predictions to the Optiver 2023 competition platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero-Sum Function (`def zero_sum(prices, volumes):`)**\n",
    "   - This function accepts two NumPy arrays: `prices` representing price predictions, and `volumes` representing trade volumes.\n",
    "   - It calculates the standard error (`std_error`) by taking the square root of `volumes`.\n",
    "   - It computes a scaling factor `step` by dividing the total of `prices` by the cumulative sum of `std_error`.\n",
    "   - The function adjusts the `prices` using the calculated `step` and `std_error`, producing an output array `out` that ensures a zero-sum constraint.\n",
    "   - The `out` array is then returned, providing the adjusted price predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inference Mode Check (`if is_infer:`)**\n",
    "   - This conditional block is triggered if the `is_infer` variable is set to `True`, signaling that the model is operating in inference mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Competition Environment Setup**\n",
    "   - The `optiver2023` module is imported to interact with the competition environment.\n",
    "   - An environment object (`env`) is instantiated for interfacing with the Optiver 2023 competition's data and submission system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Variable Initialization**\n",
    "   - Key variables for processing the test data are initialized, including an iterator (`iter_test`), a count variable (`counter`), and bounds for the predictions (`y_min` and `y_max`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "   - Lists to track queries per second (`qps`) and a DataFrame (`cache`) for holding test data are set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test Data Iteration**\n",
    "   - The code enters a loop, processing the test data batches as provided by the competition environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Loop Operations**\n",
    "   - Current time (`now_time`) is logged for performance tracking.\n",
    "   - Incoming test data is appended to the `cache`, maintaining a rolling window of the most recent entries.\n",
    "   - The `generate_all_features` function is called to extract predictive features from the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Prediction Generation**\n",
    "   - Predictions are made using the XGBoost model (`infer_model`) trained earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Prediction Adjustment**\n",
    "   - The `zero_sum` function is applied to the predictions, ensuring compliance with the zero-sum constraint of the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Prediction Clipping**\n",
    "   - Predictions are clipped to the predefined bounds (`y_min` and `y_max`) to meet competition rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Prediction Submission Preparation**\n",
    "   - The sample submission is updated with the clipped prediction values.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Prediction Submission**\n",
    "   - The updated predictions are submitted through the competition environment's `env.predict()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Performance Monitoring**\n",
    "   - The `counter` is incremented, and processing speed (`qps`) is calculated for each batch of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Performance Reporting**\n",
    "   - Iteration count and average queries per second are reported periodically to monitor and adjust the inference process.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Completion Time Estimation**\n",
    "   - Upon completion of the test data processing, the average qps is used to estimate and report the total time taken for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code has been configured for the purpose of executing predictions within the Optiver 2023 trading challenge, utilizing an XGBoost model for inference. It integrates a specific transformation procedure (`zero_sum`) and enforces a prediction range prior to submitting these predictions to the competition's evaluation system.\n"
